my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? It loops through 1-20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? Supposed to print when i is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? It takes on teh value of 1-20 when loops
